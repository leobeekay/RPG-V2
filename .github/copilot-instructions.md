I am using the NEW version of Gamemaker. Full documentation for Gamemaker is in MANUAL folder or at https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/#t=Content.htm

If I get compiler error  GMSC Error: Record version 0 is different than that of this release: 1 then I need to reload project in Gamemaker., please remind me about it in case I forget what to do with such errors.
