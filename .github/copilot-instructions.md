I am using the NEW version of Gamemaker. Full documentation for Gamemaker is in MANUAL folder or at https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/#t=Content.htm

Whenever I ask for help with an object, check relevant yy file (for example, for obj_player, check obj_player.yy) and make sure   "eventList" is not empty. If it is empty, please remind me to check that all events (create event, draw event etc) are added to the object from within GameMaker.

If I get compiler error  `GMSC Error: Record version 0 is different than that of this release: 1`, then I need to reload project in Gamemaker., please remind me about it ONLY if I ask for help with errors.

Add noticeable emojis to all importand reminders (i.e. to check events or to check),  and make they less verbose
